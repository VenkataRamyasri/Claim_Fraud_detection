## Project Description

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent healthcare insurance claims using machine learning and deep learning techniques. An Autoencoder model is used for anomaly detection to identify unusual claim patterns, while K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and XGBoost are applied for classification of genuine and fraudulent claims. By combining these approaches, the system improves accuracy and reliability in identifying fraud, helping reduce financial losses and enhance decision-making in healthcare insurance systems.
